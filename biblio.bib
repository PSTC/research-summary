abstract="Sized types provides a type-based mechanism to enforce termination of recursive definitions in typed $\lambda$-calculi. Previous work has provided strong indications that type-based termination provides an appropriate foundation for proof assistants based on type theory; however, most work to date has been confined to non-dependent type systems. In this article, we introduce a variant of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions with sized types and study its meta theoretical properties: subject reduction, normalization, and thus consistency and decidability of type-checking and of size-inference. A prototype implementation has been developed alongside case studies.",

abstract="We introduce a polymorphic $\lambda$-calculus that features inductive types and that enforces termination of recursive definitions through typing. Then, we define a sound and complete type inference algorithm that computes a set of constraints to be satisfied for terms to be typable. In addition, we show that Subject Reduction fails in a naive use of typed-based termination for a $\lambda$-calculus {\`a} la Church, and we propose a general solution to this problem.",

abstract="Sized types provide an expressive and compositional framework for proving termination and productivity of (co-)recursive definitions. In this paper, we study sized types with linear annotations of the form {\$}n{\textperiodcentered}$\alpha$+m{\$}with n and m natural numbers. Concretely, we present a type system with linear sized types for the Calculus of Constructions extended with one inductive type (natural numbers) and one coinductive type (streams). We show that this system satisfies desirable metatheoretical properties, including strong normalization, and give a sound and complete size-inference algorithm.",
